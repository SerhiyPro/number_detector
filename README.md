# Number detector
Neural network that allows you to predict numbers from dataset files that represent pictures

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
For getting better efficiency it is strongly recommended to download bigger datasets:
* [Training mnist dataset](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/mnist_train.csv) (60,000 values)
* [Testing mnist dataset](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/mnist_test.csv) (10,000 values)    

In case you want to get easier start without additional downloading, use files in dataset directory.   
Use pip (package manager) to install all requirements from the requirements.txt file

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

Run run.py file

For windows:
```
python run.py
```
For unix-like operating systems:
```
python3 run.py
```
